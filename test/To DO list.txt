1) Check Python Client - DONE
2) Add all commands
3) check formats and send error if not in specified format
4) Add Test Cases


1) When client fails midway
2) The append and prepend commands do not accept flags or exptime.  They update existing data portions, and ignore new flag and exptime settings.
3) <exptime> is expiration time. If it's 0, the item never expires
  (although it may be deleted from the cache to make place for other
  items). If it's non-zero (either Unix time or offset in seconds from
  current time), it is guaranteed that clients will not be able to
  retrieve this item after the expiration time arrives (measured by
  server time). If a negative value is given the item is immediately
  expired.
4) Client says false messages when bytes to send is 30 but only sends 10
5) Concurrent access
6) Check for no reply parameter optional
7) Handle Expiration Time.
8) Handle Format Checks for each commands
